        <p>
            A mobile development framework is a software framework that is designed to support mobile app development. It is a software library that provides a fundamental structure to support the development of applications for a specific environment.
            <br><br>
            Frameworks can be in three categories: native frameworks for platform-specific development, mobile web app frameworks, and hybrid apps, which combine the features of both native and mobile web app frameworks.
